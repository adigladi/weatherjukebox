# weatherjukebox - intro

<b>Our project will retrieve the users location (via geolocation or user input) and give music suggestions based on the current weather.</b>

<p>The app takes weather info from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap's API</a>, gets song info from <a href="https://developers.deezer.com/api/explorer">Deezer's API</a> and finally plays music using a player from Deezer.</p>

<p>The app is deployed using Firebase and can be found <a href="https://weather-jukebox.firebaseapp.com/">here</a>.</p>

# about the actual work

<ul>
<li><b>What we have done</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>A welcome page where the user can type in their location or have it decided by geolocation and then press "get jukebox'd" to get a music suggestion.</li>
    <li>A 'user' section where the user can se their saved and disliked ("blacklisted") tracks. The user can also remove tracks from either of the lists. The section consists of two views/pages.</li>
    <li>A loading screen, present while fetching data from the Deezer API.</li>
    <li>A 'jukebox' page, that plays music for the user and displays information about weather and genre. The user has the ability to add the song to their favourites list or add it to a blacklist to ensure that this particular song is not suggested again.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>What we still plan to do</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>User data will be stored using Firebase.</li>
    <li>The user interaction for the favourites and blacklist will be improved.</li>

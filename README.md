# weatherjukebox

<b>Our project will retrieve the users location (via geolocation or user input) and give music suggestions based on the current weather.</b>

<ul>
<li>What we have done</li>
<ul>
    <li>A welcome page where the user can type in their location or have it decided by geolocation.</li>
    <li>A 'user' page where the user can se their saved and disliked ("blacklisted") tracks. The user can also remove tracks from either of the lists.</li>
    <li>A loading screen, present while fetching data from the Deezer API.</li>
    <li>A 'jukebox' page, that plays music for the user and displays information about weather and genre. The user has the ability to add the song to their favourites list or add it to a blacklist to ensure that this particular song is not suggested again.</li>
</ul>
<li>What you still plan to do</li>
<li>Your project file structure (short description/purpose of each file)</li>
